        <h2>Here are some facts about me!</h2>
        <h3>I never have really been a interesting person but, I like to game with my dad and my brother,
            Help them out on project vehicles, and go to races with them.</h3>

            <p>I have always enjoyed doing different stuff wheather it was outside or inside.</p>

            <pre>&lt;h2&gt;I am currently learning how to code a small website like using this tag for my text&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>

            <h3>I think of myself as the <span>type of person that always</span> tries to find the good in people, <span>aswell as I like to push myself</span> to see what I can accomplish in my lifetime</h3>

            <hr/>

            <p>This was my little website for this project on day 4 of class, so far this class is my favorite class that I have taken in school.
                I am glad i found this class as it is something great to work forward to in my future.</p>
